1. Normalized READ & WRITE ECT in ms/KB:

(total_read_io_time_t2 - total_read_io_time_t1)/

(total_time_metric_based_read_io_bytes_t2 - total_time_metric_based_read_io_bytes_t1)

(total_write_io_time_t2 - total_write_io_time_t1)/

(total_time_metric_based_write_io_bytes_t2 - total_time_metric_based_write_io_bytes_t1)



2. Normalized Read & Write DAL in ms/KB:

(total_read_io_initiation_time_t2 - total_read_io_initiation_time_t1)/

(total_time_metric_based_read_io_bytes_t2 - total_time_metric_based_read_io_bytes_t1)

(total_write_io_initiation_time_t2 - total_write_io_initiation_time_t1)/

(total_time_metric_based_write_io_bytes_t2 - total_time_metric_based_write_io_bytes_t1)



3. Avg READ & WRITE ECT per IO:

(total_read_io_time_t2 - total_read_io_time_t1) /

(total_time_metric_based_read_io_count_t2 - total_time_metric_based_read_io_count_t1)

(total_write_io_time_t2 - total_write_io_time_t1) /

(total_time_metric_based_write_io_count_t2 - total_time_metric_based_write_io_count_t1)



4. Avg Read & Write IOPS:

(total_read_io_count_t2 - total_read_io_count_t1)/

(sampling_end_time - sampling_start_time) in seconds

(total_write_io_count_t2 - total_write_io_count_t1)/

(sampling_end_time - sampling_start_time) in seconds



5. Avg Read & Write IO Size:

total_read_io_bytes/total_read_io_count

total_write_io_bytes/total_write_io_count



Notes:

1) The following metrics are today not part of streaming metrics today and will be added shortly.

- total_time_metric_based_read_io_bytes

- total_time_metric_based_write_io_bytes

Till then please use total_read_io_bytes and total_write_io_bytes as a substitute of the above.



2) Avg Read/Write IOPs computation can be incorrect when port sampling interval and streaming interval are configured to be different.

However for NX-OS C-release we are recommending that these two values should be the same.

Hence we can use the above formula for now and fix it for all combinations of timers in the next release.



3) Pls map all the above metric names to the appropriate GPBKV short names.
